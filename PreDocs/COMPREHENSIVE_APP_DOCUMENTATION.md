## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL (v12+)
- Angular CLI (v18+)
- Git

### Database Setup
1. **Install PostgreSQL** and create database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE coach_app;
   CREATE USER micahlloyd WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE coach_app TO micahlloyd;
   ```

2. **Initialize Database Schema**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node scripts/init-db.js
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3002
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=coach_app
   DB_USER=micahlloyd
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
   ```

3. **Start Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Test Data Creation
```bash
cd server
node create-elite-team.js  # Creates comprehensive test team
```

## Best Practices & Guidelines

### Code Organization
1. **Component Structure**: Use Angular standalone components for better tree-shaking
2. **Service Injection**: Implement dependency injection for testability
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data models
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across API and frontend

### Database Best Practices
1. **Normalization**: Properly normalized schema with foreign key constraints
2. **Indexing**: Index frequently queried columns (team_id, player_id)
3. **Validation**: Database-level constraints for data integrity
4. **Transactions**: Use transactions for multi-table operations

### API Design
1. **RESTful**: Follow REST conventions for endpoint design
2. **Authentication**: JWT middleware for protected routes
3. **Validation**: Input validation using express-validator
4. **Error Responses**: Consistent error response format

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Reactive Programming**: Use RxJS observables for async operations
2. **Component Communication**: Parent-child communication via @Input/@Output
3. **State Management**: Service-based state for shared data
4. **Lazy Loading**: Route-based code splitting for performance

### Security Considerations
1. **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds
2. **JWT Security**: Secure token storage and expiration
3. **Input Sanitization**: Prevent SQL injection and XSS
4. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin requests

### Performance Optimization
1. **Database Queries**: Efficient queries with proper joins
2. **Caching**: Service-level caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Bundle Size**: Tree-shaking and lazy loading
4. **Image Optimization**: Compressed images and proper sizing

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Component and service testing with Jasmine/Karma
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
3. **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing with Cypress
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing for API endpoints
