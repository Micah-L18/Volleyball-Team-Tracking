# Half-Star Rating System Test Plan

## Overview
The half-star rating system allows coaches to provide more granular skill assessments using decimal ratings (e.g., 2.5 stars).

## Features Implemented
1. **Double-click Detection**: Single click = full star, double click = half star
2. **Visual Half-Star Display**: Uses SVG clipping to show half-filled stars
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Works in category view, list view, and bulk rating modal
4. **Smart Rating Logic**: Handles edge cases and provides clear visual feedback

## Test Cases

### 1. Category View Half-Star Rating
- Navigate to Skills tab for any player
- Single-click on the 3rd star of any skill → Should set rating to 3.0
- Double-click on the 3rd star → Should set rating to 2.5
- Verify visual display shows 2 full stars + 1 half star

### 2. List View Half-Star Rating
- Switch to "List View" 
- Single-click on 4th star → Should set rating to 4.0
- Double-click on 4th star → Should set rating to 3.5
- Verify display shows 3 full stars + 1 half star + 1 empty star

### 3. Bulk Rating Modal Half-Star Rating
- Click "Add Bulk Rating" button
- For any skill, single-click 2nd star → Should set to 2.0
- For same skill, double-click 2nd star → Should set to 1.5
- Verify half-star display in modal

### 4. Rating Persistence
- Set various half-star ratings
- Navigate away from Skills tab and return
- Verify all half-star ratings are preserved correctly

### 5. Visual Validation
- Half stars should show as left-half filled with yellow, right-half empty/gray
- Full stars should be completely yellow
- Empty stars should be completely gray
- Rating text should display correctly (e.g., "2.5", "3.0")

## Expected Behaviors

### Click Timing Logic
- Single click: Immediate rating update to full star value
- Double click (within 300ms): Rating update to half star value
- Visual feedback should be immediate

### Rating Display Logic
```
Rating 0: No stars filled
Rating 0.5: Half of first star filled
Rating 1.0: First star fully filled
Rating 1.5: First star full + half of second star
Rating 2.0: Two stars fully filled
Rating 2.5: Two stars full + half of third star
... and so on up to 5.0
```

### SVG Half-Star Implementation
- Uses `clipPath` to show only left half of star
- Each half-star has unique ID to avoid conflicts
- Proper layering: empty star background + clipped filled star overlay

## Backend Support
The backend already supports decimal ratings in the database and API endpoints, so half-star ratings (like 2.5, 3.5) will be properly stored and retrieved.

## Success Criteria
✅ Double-click detection works reliably  
✅ Half-star visual display is clear and intuitive  
✅ All three views (category, list, bulk) support half-stars  
✅ Ratings persist correctly in database  
✅ No visual glitches or conflicts  
✅ User experience is smooth and responsive
