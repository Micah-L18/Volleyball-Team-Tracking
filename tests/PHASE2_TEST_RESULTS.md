## Features Verified

### Core Authentication Flow
- ✅ User registration with first_name, last_name, email, password, role
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Duplicate email prevention
- ✅ Input validation for required fields

### Role System
- ✅ Support for all required roles: head_coach, assistant_coach, player, parent
- ✅ Role validation during registration
- ✅ Team-based role assignment ready for Phase 3

### Security Features
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Protected route middleware
- ✅ Password encryption
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Error handling without information leakage

### Database Integration
- ✅ PostgreSQL connection established
- ✅ Users table with proper schema
- ✅ Team-based architecture ready (users, teams, team_users tables)
- ✅ Database queries optimized for team relationships

## Technical Achievements

### Backend API
- ✅ Express.js server with proper middleware
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Request logging
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Environment configuration

### Database Architecture
- ✅ 13 table schema designed for volleyball team management
- ✅ User-centric authentication (not coach-specific)
- ✅ Team-based role assignment system
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Jest test framework configured
- ✅ Supertest for API testing
- ✅ Automated test suite
- ✅ Test environment isolation
- ✅ Database connection for testing

## Issues Resolved During Testing

1. **Database Connection**: Fixed environment variable configuration for tests
2. **Server Port Conflicts**: Configured test server to use different port
3. **Module Loading**: Modified server to not auto-start when required for testing
4. **Test Isolation**: Ensured tests run independently without side effects

## Phase 2 Status: COMPLETE ✅

The authentication system is fully functional and ready for production use. All critical authentication flows have been tested and verified.

## Ready for Phase 3: Team Management

With authentication fully validated, we can now proceed to implement:
- Team creation and management
- Team member invitations
- Role assignment within teams
- Team-specific data access control

**Next Action:** Proceed with Phase 3 implementation
